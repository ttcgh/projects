Carbon Intensity Project
-------------------------

This repo contains my R code that cleaned and manipulated data from the Energy Information Administration, and my R code that created the carbon intensity visualizations. The visualizations show changing carbon intensities for individual states within the U.S. between 1990 and 2015. I used MySQL to create the main database (carbonintensity.csv; code not included in this repo). This repo contains other csv files used to create the visualizations.
